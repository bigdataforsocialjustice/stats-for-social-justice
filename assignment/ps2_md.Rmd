This assignment builds upon Public Health Foundational Knowledge GIA-1 and Foundational Competencies GIA-1. 
**Note** to submit this email me with the subject "Problem Set 2"
:::

## Task 1: Confounding

1. Go the the example page for this week, ["Coundounding"](/example/Confounding.qmd), and work through the analyses I replicated based on the article for that week.

Please make sure you are familiar with how to interpret and calculate risk ratios (RR) and odds ratios (ORs)


## Task 2: Make an RStudio Project

1. Use either RStudio.cloud or RStudio on your computer (preferably RStudio on your computer! [Follow these instructions to get started!](/resource/install.qmd)) to create a new RStudio Project. Refer to the [example page you read in Task 1 for instructions](/example/rstudio-tidyverse.qmd#part-3-rstudio-projects)

2. Create a folder named "data" in the project folder you just made.

3. Download this **SPSS** file and place it in that folder:

    - [{{< fa file-csv >}} `moderation.sav`](https://github.com/bigdataforsocialjustice/PHHBHP7534/blob/main/moderation.sav)

4. In RStudio, go to "File" > "New File…" > "R Markdown…" and click "OK" in the dialog without changing anything.

5. Run the following code


::: callout-note
Answer the questions A - K below. You can simply type text in the white space, and write R code in the chunks.
**Note**: I have written all of the code except for J. and K. below. The code you need to answer J and K can be found [here](/example/moderation.qmd)
:::

**A. Go through the code and identify which each package is doing.** Note that the code opens .SAV files not .CSV files so it is slightly different from what we have seen before.

```{r}
library(foreign)
library(dplyr)
library(epitools)
library(effects)
library(epitools)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```
```{r}

```


```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/barboza-salerno.1/Downloads/")
moderation_example = read.spss("moderation.sav", use.value.labels = F, to.data.frame = T)
str(moderation_example)
```

```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/barboza-salerno.1/Downloads/")
moderation_example = tibble::as_tibble(read.spss("moderation.sav", use.value.labels = F, to.data.frame = T))

```

```{r}
str(moderation_example)
```



# Learning R: Data Wrangling

The following code uses the language of tidyverse to select, filter, factor, recode, and clean the data.
Go line by line and explain what each line is doing (hint, the best way I have found to learn is to run each line and see how the data changes). For example, run this:

`library(dplyr)

moderation_example %>%
  dplyr::select(tra1, sexab)`

then run this

`library(dplyr)

moderation_example %>%
  dplyr::select(tra1, sexab) %>%
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(sexab))`  

etc  
```{r}
moderation_example %>%
  dplyr::select(tra1, sexab) %>%
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(sexab)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(sex = dplyr::recode(sexab, `1` = "Yes", `0` = "No")) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(PTSD = cut(tra1, breaks = c(33, 64, 88), include.lowest = T, labels = c("No PTSD", "PTSD"))) %>%
  dplyr::select(-sexab, -tra1)
```

```{r  results='hide'}
df <- moderation_example %>%
  dplyr::select(tra1, sexab) %>%
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(sexab)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(sex = dplyr::recode(sexab, `1` = "Yes", `0` = "No")) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(PTSD = cut(tra1, breaks = c(33, 64, 88), include.lowest = T, labels = c("No PTSD", "PTSD"))) %>%
  dplyr::select(-sexab, -tra1)
```

Assign the new data table to an object call it `df`
```{r}
table(df$sex, df$PTSD)
```
Re-arrange the numbers in the table so that we have sexual abuse (Yes) and PTSD (Yes) in the first cell.

```{r}
(total <- matrix(c(47, 168, 289, 1275), nrow = 2, ncol = 2))
```

#### B. Interpret the RR of PTSD for those who were sexually abused (versus not) below

#### C. Compute the percent change in the risk below

```{r}
(all_risk <- riskratio.wald(total, rev = c("neither")))
```

#### D. Interpret the odds ratio below

#### Calculate the percent change in the odds below

```{r}
oddsratio.wald(total, rev = c("neither"))
```

#### Moderation

Is the association between DEL and PTSS the same for youth who have been sexually abused and not?

```{r}
df <- moderation_example %>%
  dplyr::select(bcdel1, tra1, sexab) %>%
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(sexab), !is.na(tra1)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(sex =  dplyr::recode(sexab, `1` = "Yes", `0` = "No")) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(tra1_mean = tra1-mean(tra1)) %>%
  dplyr::select(-tra1)

levels(df$sex) <- c("No","Yes")

```

```{r}
(fit <- lm(bcdel1 ~ tra1_mean:sex, data = df))
summary(fit)
```

#### E. Interpret the intercept of the model above
#### F. Is the interaction significant?
#### G. Interpret the interaction 
#### G. Interpret the 2 plots below

The `effects` package is another nice way to visualze the interaction effects. Let's practice below.
```{r}
interact <- effect('tra1_mean:sex', fit,
                      xlevels=list(tra1_mean = c(-15, 0, 30)),
                      se=TRUE, confidence.level=.95, typical=mean)

interact<-as.data.frame(interact)
interact$sex<-factor(interact$sex, levels=c("No", "Yes"))

```

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(data=interact, aes(x=tra1_mean, y=fit, group=sex))+
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(50,70))+  
  #For ylim, specify the range of your DV (in our case, 50-70)
  geom_line(size=2, aes(color=sex))+
  ylab("DEL")+
  xlab("PTSS")+
  ggtitle("PTSS and Sex Abuse as Predictors of Delinquent Behaviors")+
  theme_bw()+ 
  theme(panel.grid.major=element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor=element_blank())+
  scale_fill_grey()
p1

```
#### I. Interpret the visualization: 
Does higher levels of PTSS matter more for engagement in delinquent behaviors for youth who have been sexually abused? Why/Why not?

#### J. Write the Code for the Conceptual Model

#### K. Write the Code for the Statistical Model
