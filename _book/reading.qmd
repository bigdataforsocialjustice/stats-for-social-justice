# Required Texts

### [*OpenIntro Statistics*](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/)

Supplemental functions and data for OpenIntro resources, which includes open-source textbooks and resources for introductory statistics at [openintro.org](https://www.openintro.org/). The package contains datasets used in our open-source textbooks along with custom plotting functions for reproducing book figures. The package also contains the datasets used in OpenIntro labs. Note that many functions and examples include color transparency; some plotting elements may not show up properly (or at all) when run in some versions of Windows operating system.

### Installation of datasets

The datasets used in the book (and the class) are available [here](https://www.openintro.org/data/).

You can install the data from released version of `openintro` available from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("openintro")
```

You can install the development version of openintro from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("OpenIntroStat/openintro")
```

This package was produced as part of the OpenIntro project. For the accompanying textbook, visit [openintro.org](https://openintro.org). A PDF of the textbook is free and paperbacks can be purchased online (royalty-free).
