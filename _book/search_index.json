The dataset used in this study, KSPRAMS_SUB_WEIGHT_ANALYSIS.csv, included key variables such as maternal smoking during the first trimester (CIG_1TRI), history of abuse (Any_Abuse), Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs_Scale), perinatal depression (BPG_DEPRS8), and race/ethnicity (Race_Ethnicity). To ensure data integrity, cases with missing values were omitted, resulting in a final analytical sample of 5,172 participants. "],["objectives.html", "17 Objectives", " 17 Objectives The primary objective of this study was to investigate the association between maternal smoking during the first trimester and key psychosocial risk factors, including a history of abuse, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), and perinatal depression. Additionally, the study examined racial/ethnic differences in smoking behavior and the potential moderating role of race/ethnicity on the identified associations. "],["statistical-analysis.html", "18 Statistical Analysis", " 18 Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistics were generated to summarize the characteristics of the sample. Linear regression models were constructed to estimate the association between smoking during the first trimester (dependent variable) and key independent variables, adjusting for potential confounders. Race/ethnicity was included as a categorical predictor (Hispanic, Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic White, and Other). The variance inflation factor (VIF) was computed to assess multicollinearity. Model 0 examined the bivariate association between Any_Abuse and CIG_1TRI. Model 1 added ACEs_Scale, and Model 2 incorporated BPG_DEPRS8. Finally, Model 3 included race/ethnicity to test for potential racial/ethnic disparities in smoking behavior. Model performance was assessed using R², adjusted R², and F-statistics. To verify regression assumptions, diagnostic plots were generated, including residual plots for linearity and homogeneity of variance, an influential observations plot, a VIF assessment, and a normality of residuals plot. Tests for heteroscedasticity and normality violations were performed, and estimated marginal means were used for post-hoc comparisons. "],["results.html", "19 Results", " 19 Results A history of abuse was associated with a 2.29-unit increase in smoking during the first trimester (B = 2.29, p &lt; 0.001). In Model 1, both Any_Abuse (B = 1.85, p &lt; 0.001) and ACEs_Scale (B = 0.44, p &lt; 0.001) remained significant predictors, with higher ACE scores corresponding to increased smoking likelihood. A one standard deviation increase in ACEs_Scale (1.41 points) was associated with a 0.62-unit increase in smoking, while an interquartile range (IQR) increase (2 points) was associated with a 0.89-unit increase. Model 2 demonstrated that perinatal depression (BPG_DEPRS8) was a significant predictor of smoking (B = 1.04, p &lt; 0.001). Mothers with perinatal depression smoked an average of 1.04 more cigarettes per day compared to those without depression. Similarly, mothers with a history of abuse smoked an average of 1.85 more cigarettes per day compared to those without a history of abuse. In Model 3, race/ethnicity was included to assess disparities in smoking behavior. Compared to Non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanic mothers exhibited significantly lower smoking rates (B = -0.93, p &lt; 0.001), while Non-Hispanic Black and Other racial groups did not significantly differ from Non-Hispanic Whites. Post-hoc comparisons of estimated marginal means confirmed that Hispanic mothers had the lowest estimated smoking rates (M = 1.23, 95% CI [0.91, 1.54]), whereas Non-Hispanic Whites had the highest (M = 2.16, 95% CI [1.96, 2.36]). Diagnostics revealed a violation of the normality assumption (p &lt; 0.001), and heteroscedasticity was detected (p &lt; 0.001), suggesting non-constant error variance. However, no multicollinearity issues were present, as all VIF values were below 5. Outlier analysis showed no extreme influential observations affecting model estimates.

A history of abuse, adverse childhood experiences, and perinatal depression were robust predictors of smoking, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions. Racial/ethnic disparities were observed, with Hispanic mothers exhibiting lower smoking rates compared to Non-Hispanic Whites. These findings underscore the importance of integrating mental health and trauma-informed care into prenatal smoking cessation programs. 20.1 Room 0: Welcome to the Escape Room! 20.1.1 Why is this important? 20.2 Room 1: Finding and Opening Data 20.2.1 What Is This Data? 20.2.2 Challenge: 20.3 Room 2: Downloading the Dataset 20.3.1 Instructions: 20.3.2 Challenge: 20.3.3 Challenge: 20.4 Room 3: Opening the Dataset 20.4.0.1 Instructions: 20.4.0.2 Example Code (Hidden in Exercise): 20.4.1 Challenge: 20.5 Room 4: Exploring Metropolitan Areas 20.5.1 Why Metropolitan Areas Matter 20.5.2 Challenge: 20.6 Room 5: Understanding Historic Redlining 20.6.1 Redlining and Its Impacts 20.6.2 Challenge: 20.7 Room 6: Calculating Average Redlining Scores 20.7.1 Example Code: 20.7.2 Now it’s your turn: 20.8 Room 6: Visualizing the Data 20.8.1 Importance of Visualization 20.8.2 Example Code: 20.8.3 Challenge: 20.9 Congratulations!
