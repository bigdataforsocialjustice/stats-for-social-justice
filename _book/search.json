Through this process, students will develop a deeper understanding of how regression can be used to predict outcomes and test hypotheses in social work research.\nIn this unit we will learn to quantify the relationship between two numerical variables, as well as modeling numerical response variables using a numerical or categorical explanatory variable.\n\n\nWhat will students learn this week?\n\nThe fundamental components of a simple linear regression model (slope, intercept, and residuals).\nHow to interpret regression output, including unstandardized and standardized coefficients.\nThe practical steps to fit a simple linear regression model in R using lm().\nHow to visualize regression results and residuals using ggplot2.\n\n\n\n\nWhy is this topic important?\nSimple Linear Regression serves as the building block for more advanced statistical methods, such as multiple regression, moderation, and mediation analysis.

Study design This was a prospective cohort study of English/Spanish-speaking parents (n = 165) of children \\(\\leq\\)12 years discharged on \\(\\geq\\)1 daily medication from an urban, public hospital. Outcome variables were parent comprehension (survey) of and adherence (survey, in-person dosing assessment, chart review) to discharge instructions. Predictor variables included low parent health literacy (Newest Vital Sign score 0-3) and plan complexity. Generalized estimating equations were used to account for the assessment of multiple types of comprehension and adherence errors for each subject, adjusting for ethnicity, language, child age, length of stay, and chronic disease status. Similar analyses were performed to assess for mediation and moderation. Results Error rates were highest for comprehension of medication side effects (50%), adherence to medication dose (34%), and return precaution (78%) instructions. Comprehension errors were associated with adherence errors (aOR, 8.7; 95% CI, 5.9-12.9). Discharge plan complexity was associated with comprehension (aOR, 7.0; 95% CI, 5.4-9.1) and adherence (aOR, 5.5; 95% CI, 4.0-7.6) errors. Low health literacy was indirectly associated with adherence errors through comprehension errors. The association between plan complexity and comprehension errors was greater in parents with low (aOR, 8.3; 95% CI, 6.2-11.2) compared with adequate (aOR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.2-6.5) health literacy (interaction term P = .004). Conclusions Parent health literacy and discharge plan complexity play key roles in comprehension and adherence errors. Future work will focus on the development of health literacy-informed interventions to promote discharge plan comprehension.\n\n\nLittleton, T., Freisthler, B., Boyd, R., Smith, A.

    "text": "Course Goals and Objectives\nThe course, Statistics II focuses on an equitable approach to data analysis. It aims to equip students with advanced statistical techniques while fostering critical thinking about how to apply those models to social work applications. I have tried to find a good balance of instruction, innovation, and hands-on learning. I want you to be excited about statistics and data; hence, I have tried to stucture the course in a way that encourages you to explore regression, measurement, and latent variable models in the context of social justice. By emphasizing storytelling and data interpretation, students will develop the skills needed to reclaim and communicate narratives of oppression, focusing on equity and systemic challenges. The course also focuses on practical applications, such as building models and interpreting statistical findings to support policy changes and advocate for marginalized communities.\nOne of the course’s primary objectives is to prepare students to use statistics as a tool for actionable change. Weekly sessions integrate technical skills, such as using R for data analysis and visualization, with real-world social work challenges. Activities like the “Data Makeover Challenge” and “Latent Storytelling” push students to think creatively about data, while assignments emphasize ethical implications and advocacy. My idea about writing an oped comes from the workshop I did in the summer of 2024, where I learned how to write one effectively. You can read it here.\nI have also tried very hard to make the course integrative. That is the reason for this website. There are (and will be) links between modules, readings, and assignments so that everything is connected as it should be. This is obviously a lot of work, so I appreciate your patience, and consideration.\nHopefully, by the end of the semester, students will have gained not only proficiency in statistical methods but also the confidence to apply them meaningfully to address pressing social issues.",

    "text": "Explanation of Correlation Types\n\nCorrelation\nDefinition: Measures the direct (linear) relationship between two variables without controlling for other influences.\n\nWhat does it ask? “How strongly are two variables associated?” “When one variable increases, does the other also increase (positive correlation), decrease (negative correlation), or are the variables not linearly related?”\nWhy does this matter?\n\n\nIdentifies basic associations: Helps determine whether two variables have a relationship worth further investigation.\nGuides hypothesis development: Provides an initial understanding before applying more complex statistical techniques like partial correlation or regression.\nDoes not imply causation: A strong correlation does not mean one variable causes changes in the other; it simply indicates they move together.\n\n\nExample Interpretation: If ACEs and Stress During Pregnancy have a positive correlation, it suggests that individuals with higher adverse childhood experiences tend to experience more stress during pregnancy. However, other factors (e.g., education, income) could be influencing this relationship.\nPositive values indicate a direct relationship (when one increases, the other also increases).\nNegative values indicate an inverse relationship (when one increases, the other decreases).\nValues closer to 0 suggest a weak or no linear association between the variables. This DOES NOT mean that no relationship exists.\n\n\n\nPartial Correlation\nDefinition: Measures the direct relationship between two variables while controlling for the effect of a third variable.\n\nWhat does it ask? “What is the association between Maternal Education and Stress During Pregnancy, after removing the effect of ACEs from both?”\n\nWhy does this matter? If the correlation remains significant, this suggests that education independently contributes to stress beyond what can be explained by early-life adversity.\n\n\n\nSemi-Partial (Part) Correlation\nDefinition: Measures the relationship between two variables while controlling for a third variable’s effect on just one of them.\n\nWhat does it ask? “What is the association between Maternal Education and Stress During Pregnancy, after removing the effect of ACEs only from Stress During Pregnancy?”\nWhy does this matter? If the relationship weakens, it suggests that ACEs account for some of the variance in how education affects stress. Another way to think about this is that ACEs partly explain how education effects stress. And, yet another ‘connect-the-dots’ moment is that tf the relationship weakens, then ACEs mediate some of the observed effects of education on stress",

Higher maternal education is linked to lower stress, potentially due to greater access to resources, stability, or support systems. This is important. When interpreting results, it is very important to go back to the original operationalization of the variables so we are on the same page. How is stress defined here? And, what may be some limitations both methodologicall and conceptually? Whereas we know this analysis is not causal, we can begin linking the results to some important policy implications See Barboza-Salerno (2020) here .",

Higher maternal education is linked to lower stress, potentially due to greater access to resources, stability, or support systems. These relationships highlight the importance of addressing early-life adversity and improving access to education as potential strategies for reducing stress during pregnancy and improving maternal health outcomes.",

Using partial and semi-partial correlations, we disentangle the direct and indirect effects of early-life adversity on maternal stress, providing insights for interventions aimed at reducing stress-related health disparities. If ACEs remains a significant predictor of stress after controlling for education, interventions targeting early life adversity may help alleviate psychosocial stress during pregnancy, improving both maternal and child health outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nBarboza-Salerno, G.
