Students will learn how to interpret the slope, intercept, and residuals, and use regression output to draw meaningful conclusions about data. Through this process, students will develop a deeper understanding of how regression can be used to predict outcomes and test hypotheses in social work research.\nIn this unit we will learn to quantify the relationship between two numerical variables, as well as modeling numerical response variables using a numerical or categorical explanatory variable.\n\n\nWhat will students learn this week?\n\nThe fundamental components of a simple linear regression model (slope, intercept, and residuals).\nHow to interpret regression output, including unstandardized and standardized coefficients.\nThe practical steps to fit a simple linear regression model in R using lm().\nHow to visualize regression results and residuals using ggplot2.\n\n\n\n\nWhy is this topic important?\nSimple Linear Regression serves as the building block for more advanced statistical methods, such as multiple regression, moderation, and mediation analysis. It allows social work researchers to identify relationships between variables, predict outcomes, and inform data-driven decision-making. Mastering this concept is essential for understanding more complex techniques later in the course.\n\n\n\nHow does it relate to previous or future content?\n\nTies to previous content: Builds upon last week’s review of descriptive statistics and introduces the concept of relationships between variables.\nPrepares for future topics: Provides a foundation for upcoming topics like multiple regression (Week 5), where we will expand from one predictor to multiple predictors, and interaction effects (Week 9), where regression will be used to explore moderating relationships.\n\n\nThis session emphasizes the practical and theoretical importance of regression analysis, helping students connect statistical techniques to real-world social work applications.",
