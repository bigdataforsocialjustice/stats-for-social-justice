# Week 11: March 17, 2025  

## Reading

-   Hayes, Andrew. (2018). [Introduction to Mediation, Moderation, and Conditional Process Analysis](https://github.com/bigdataforsocialjustice/SWK8408/blob/master/Mediation%2C%20Moderation%20and%20Conditional%20Process%20Models.pdf) Chapters 1 - 4. 

-  [Here](static/medex.pdf) is an applied paper in Social Work that you *should* be able to understand after going through this week's materials.

## Introduction to the Topic

This week, we explore **mediation analysis**, a statistical approach used to understand the mechanisms through which an independent variable influences a dependent variable via a third variable, known as the mediator. Mediation analysis is essential for uncovering causal pathways in research.

---

## Key Concepts:
- **Direct Effects**: The relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable, excluding the mediator.
- **Indirect Effects**: The portion of the relationship explained through the mediator.
- **Total Effects**: The combined impact of direct and indirect effects.
- **Bootstrapping**: A resampling method for testing the significance of indirect effects.

---

## Relevance:
- Students will learn how to identify and test mediating variables in a causal framework. Make sure you review our discussion of [confounding]()
- Students will explore how to decompose total effects into direct and indirect components to better understand relationships among variables.

---

## Why This Is Important:
- Mediation analysis allows researchers to move beyond simple relationships to uncover *how* and *why* effects occur.
- Understanding mediation is critical for testing theoretical models in fields like psychology, sociology, and public health.

---

## How This Ties Into the Overall Course:
- Builds upon previous topics, such as [regression](03-multiple-regression.qmd) and [effect sizes](04-effect-sizes.qmd), by extending these tools to explore causal pathways.
- Prepares students for advanced concepts like moderated mediation and structural equation modeling (SEM), where mediation analysis is a core component.

By the end of this week, students will be able to conduct mediation analyses, interpret direct and indirect effects, and evaluate the significance of mediators using bootstrapping methods.

## An example of logistic regression from last week
We ran out of time last week but I put together an example and write up of [logistic regression](07-logistic-regression.qmd). This uses the PRAMS dataset to inquire about whether stress during pregnancy predicts IPV exposure during pregnancy. Recall the variable measurements which we noted [here](PRAMS_Correlation_Analysis.qmd). The JASP file is [here](slides/medmod/KPRAMS_IPV_STRESS.jasp) and it is fully annotated.

## A Note on Linear Transformations
We start class today with two a quick example of how to transform variables when the model assumptions are violated. As I mentioned in class, this trick has almost never worked with the datasets I use. However, I was successful in transforming the dependent variable once, using a cultivated dataset on area deprivation, housing, and "child maltreatment" substantiations which can be accessed [here](data/all-data.hti.sav). I have used these data often see @elisebarboza-salernoMaterialHardshipLabor2024 for an example.

The cultivated dataset comes from many sources. The H+T index comes from [this website](https://htaindex.cnt.org/). The ADI comes from the `sociome` package in R, and we saw [an example] when we learned how to quantify effect sizes with [Cohen's D](https://bigdataforsocialjustice.github.io/stats-for-social-justice/cohensd.html). I calculated the distances to SNAP retail locations from home addresses based on information from the SNAP retail locator, which can be accessed [here](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/retailer/historical-data).

## Class Files and Data Sets

We will use a subset of the [NSCAW I](data/NSCAWI_subset.sav) to examine whether symptoms of post-traumatic stress mediate the association between exposure to violence at Wave I and child externalizing behaviors at Wave III. Now DON'T LOOK at the model write-up until AFTER you have the analysis done. Then, and only then, can you take a gander at my write-up [here](slides/medmod/Mediation_Analysis_Results.docx)

After we do the above example together, we have an in-class assessment to get a sense of how well you are comprehending the analyses. This includes some multiple choice questions along with an analysis of the [Adolescent Health Survey Data](data/waves 1 and 3 merged.sav) which is a longitudinal dataset that has been collected since about 1995 when youth were 15 years of age. Please download the assessment [here](data/inclass-mediation.docx). See @elisebarbozaChildMaltreatmentSchool2021 for a similar analysis published in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence, or this paper @barbozaChildMaltreatmentDelinquent2020 that also used these data.

## Resources
This is an amazing resources from UCLA on introduction to [mediation, moderation and conditional process models](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/seminars/spss-process/). The website has a tutorial that I am strongly suggesting you do, and also additional powerpoint slides for [Andrew Hayes' book](https://github.com/bigdataforsocialjustice/SWK8408/blob/master/Mediation%2C%20Moderation%20and%20Conditional%20Process%20Models.pdf).
