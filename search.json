Students will learn how to interpret the slope, intercept, and residuals, and use regression output to draw meaningful conclusions about data. Through this process, students will develop a deeper understanding of how regression can be used to predict outcomes and test hypotheses in social work research.\nIn this unit we will learn to quantify the relationship between two numerical variables, as well as modeling numerical response variables using a numerical or categorical explanatory variable.\n\n\nWhat will students learn this week?\n\nThe fundamental components of a simple linear regression model (slope, intercept, and residuals).\nHow to interpret regression output, including unstandardized and standardized coefficients.\nThe practical steps to fit a simple linear regression model in R using lm().\nHow to visualize regression results and residuals using ggplot2.\n\n\n\n\nWhy is this topic important?\nSimple Linear Regression serves as the building block for more advanced statistical methods, such as multiple regression, moderation, and mediation analysis. It allows social work researchers to identify relationships between variables, predict outcomes, and inform data-driven decision-making. Mastering this concept is essential for understanding more complex techniques later in the course.\n\n\n\nHow does it relate to previous or future content?\n\nTies to previous content: Builds upon last week’s review of descriptive statistics and introduces the concept of relationships between variables.\nPrepares for future topics: Provides a foundation for upcoming topics like multiple regression (Week 5), where we will expand from one predictor to multiple predictors, and interaction effects (Week 9), where regression will be used to explore moderating relationships.\n\n\nThis session emphasizes the practical and theoretical importance of regression analysis, helping students connect statistical techniques to real-world social work applications.",

The Journal of Pediatrics, 214, 193–200.e3. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2019.04.052Objective To examine associations between parent health literacy, discharge plan complexity, and parent comprehension of and adherence to inpatient discharge instructions. Study design This was a prospective cohort study of English/Spanish-speaking parents (n = 165) of children \\(\\leq\\)12 years discharged on \\(\\geq\\)1 daily medication from an urban, public hospital. Outcome variables were parent comprehension (survey) of and adherence (survey, in-person dosing assessment, chart review) to discharge instructions. Predictor variables included low parent health literacy (Newest Vital Sign score 0-3) and plan complexity. Generalized estimating equations were used to account for the assessment of multiple types of comprehension and adherence errors for each subject, adjusting for ethnicity, language, child age, length of stay, and chronic disease status. Similar analyses were performed to assess for mediation and moderation. Results Error rates were highest for comprehension of medication side effects (50%), adherence to medication dose (34%), and return precaution (78%) instructions. Comprehension errors were associated with adherence errors (aOR, 8.7; 95% CI, 5.9-12.9). Discharge plan complexity was associated with comprehension (aOR, 7.0; 95% CI, 5.4-9.1) and adherence (aOR, 5.5; 95% CI, 4.0-7.6) errors. Low health literacy was indirectly associated with adherence errors through comprehension errors. The association between plan complexity and comprehension errors was greater in parents with low (aOR, 8.3; 95% CI, 6.2-11.2) compared with adequate (aOR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.2-6.5) health literacy (interaction term P = .004). Conclusions Parent health literacy and discharge plan complexity play key roles in comprehension and adherence errors. Future work will focus on the development of health literacy-informed interventions to promote discharge plan comprehension.\n\n\nLittleton, T., Freisthler, B., Boyd, R., Smith, A.

    "text": "Course Goals and Objectives\nThe course, Statistics II focuses on an equitable approach to data analysis. It aims to equip students with advanced statistical techniques while fostering critical thinking about how to apply those models to social work applications. I have tried to find a good balance of instruction, innovation, and hands-on learning. I want you to be excited about statistics and data; hence, I have tried to stucture the course in a way that encourages you to explore regression, measurement, and latent variable models in the context of social justice. By emphasizing storytelling and data interpretation, students will develop the skills needed to reclaim and communicate narratives of oppression, focusing on equity and systemic challenges. The course also focuses on practical applications, such as building models and interpreting statistical findings to support policy changes and advocate for marginalized communities.\nOne of the course’s primary objectives is to prepare students to use statistics as a tool for actionable change. Weekly sessions integrate technical skills, such as using R for data analysis and visualization, with real-world social work challenges. Activities like the “Data Makeover Challenge” and “Latent Storytelling” push students to think creatively about data, while assignments emphasize ethical implications and advocacy. My idea about writing an oped comes from the workshop I did in the summer of 2024, where I learned how to write one effectively. You can read it here.\nI have also tried very hard to make the course integrative. That is the reason for this website. There are (and will be) links between modules, readings, and assignments so that everything is connected as it should be. This is obviously a lot of work, so I appreciate your patience, and consideration.\nHopefully, by the end of the semester, students will have gained not only proficiency in statistical methods but also the confidence to apply them meaningfully to address pressing social issues.",

By using risk ratios, the data can show BOTH gross disparities of infant mortality by race and also show no racial disparities at the same time. The reason comes down to the invariance property.\nOdds ratios and risk ratios are both measures used in statistics to compare the likelihood of an event occurring between two groups.
