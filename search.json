Despite being one of the fundamental statistical ideas in ecological curricula, regression modeling can be complex and subtle. This paper is intended as an applied protocol to help students understand the data, select the most appropriate models, verify assumptions, and interpret the output. Basic ecological questions are tackled using data from a fictional series, ?Fantastic beasts and where to find them,? with the aim to show how statistical thinking can foster curiosity, creativity and imagination in ecology, from the formulation of hypotheses to the interpretation of results.\n\n\nElise Barboza, G., & Siller, L.

The Journal of Pediatrics, 214, 193–200.e3. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2019.04.052Objective To examine associations between parent health literacy, discharge plan complexity, and parent comprehension of and adherence to inpatient discharge instructions. Study design This was a prospective cohort study of English/Spanish-speaking parents (n = 165) of children \\(\\leq\\)12 years discharged on \\(\\geq\\)1 daily medication from an urban, public hospital. Outcome variables were parent comprehension (survey) of and adherence (survey, in-person dosing assessment, chart review) to discharge instructions. Predictor variables included low parent health literacy (Newest Vital Sign score 0-3) and plan complexity. Generalized estimating equations were used to account for the assessment of multiple types of comprehension and adherence errors for each subject, adjusting for ethnicity, language, child age, length of stay, and chronic disease status. Similar analyses were performed to assess for mediation and moderation. Results Error rates were highest for comprehension of medication side effects (50%), adherence to medication dose (34%), and return precaution (78%) instructions. Comprehension errors were associated with adherence errors (aOR, 8.7; 95% CI, 5.9-12.9). Discharge plan complexity was associated with comprehension (aOR, 7.0; 95% CI, 5.4-9.1) and adherence (aOR, 5.5; 95% CI, 4.0-7.6) errors. Low health literacy was indirectly associated with adherence errors through comprehension errors. The association between plan complexity and comprehension errors was greater in parents with low (aOR, 8.3; 95% CI, 6.2-11.2) compared with adequate (aOR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.2-6.5) health literacy (interaction term P = .004). Conclusions Parent health literacy and discharge plan complexity play key roles in comprehension and adherence errors. Future work will focus on the development of health literacy-informed interventions to promote discharge plan comprehension.\n\n\nJohfre, S. S., & Freese, J. (2021).

    "text": "Course Goals and Objectives\nThe course, Statistics II focuses on an equitable approach to data analysis. It aims to equip students with advanced statistical techniques while fostering critical thinking about how to apply those models to social work applications. I have tried to find a good balance of instruction, innovation, and hands-on learning. I want you to be excited about statistics and data; hence, I have tried to stucture the course in a way that encourages you to explore regression, measurement, and latent variable models in the context of social justice. By emphasizing storytelling and data interpretation, students will develop the skills needed to reclaim and communicate narratives of oppression, focusing on equity and systemic challenges. The course also focuses on practical applications, such as building models and interpreting statistical findings to support policy changes and advocate for marginalized communities.\nOne of the course’s primary objectives is to prepare students to use statistics as a tool for actionable change. Weekly sessions integrate technical skills, such as using R for data analysis and visualization, with real-world social work challenges. Activities like the “Data Makeover Challenge” and “Latent Storytelling” push students to think creatively about data, while assignments emphasize ethical implications and advocacy. My idea about writing an oped comes from the workshop I did in the summer of 2024, where I learned how to write one effectively. You can read it here.\nI have also tried very hard to make the course integrative. That is the reason for this website. There are (and will be) links between modules, readings, and assignments so that everything is connected as it should be. This is obviously a lot of work, so I appreciate your patience, and consideration.\nHopefully, by the end of the semester, students will have gained not only proficiency in statistical methods but also the confidence to apply them meaningfully to address pressing social issues.",

    "text": "Explanation of Correlation Types\n\nCorrelation\nDefinition: Measures the direct (linear) relationship between two variables without controlling for other influences.\n\nWhat does it ask? “How strongly are two variables associated?” “When one variable increases, does the other also increase (positive correlation), decrease (negative correlation), or are the variables not linearly related?”\nWhy does this matter?\n\n\nIdentifies basic associations: Helps determine whether two variables have a relationship worth further investigation.\nGuides hypothesis development: Provides an initial understanding before applying more complex statistical techniques like partial correlation or regression.\nDoes not imply causation: A strong correlation does not mean one variable causes changes in the other; it simply indicates they move together.\n\n\nExample Interpretation: If ACEs and Stress During Pregnancy have a positive correlation, it suggests that individuals with higher adverse childhood experiences tend to experience more stress during pregnancy. However, other factors (e.g., education, income) could be influencing this relationship.\nPositive values indicate a direct relationship (when one increases, the other also increases).\nNegative values indicate an inverse relationship (when one increases, the other decreases).\nValues closer to 0 suggest a weak or no linear association between the variables. This DOES NOT mean that no relationship exists.\n\n\n\nPartial Correlation\nDefinition: Measures the direct relationship between two variables while controlling for the effect of a third variable.\n\nWhat does it ask? “What is the association between Maternal Education and Stress During Pregnancy, after removing the effect of ACEs from both?”\n\nWhy does this matter? If the correlation remains significant, this suggests that education independently contributes to stress beyond what can be explained by early-life adversity.\n\n\n\nSemi-Partial (Part) Correlation\nDefinition: Measures the relationship between two variables while controlling for a third variable’s effect on just one of them.\n\nWhat does it ask? “What is the association between Maternal Education and Stress During Pregnancy, after removing the effect of ACEs only from Stress During Pregnancy?”\nWhy does this matter? If the relationship weakens, it suggests that ACEs account for some of the variance in how education affects stress. Another way to think about this is that ACEs partly explain how education effects stress. And, yet another ‘connect-the-dots’ moment is that tf the relationship weakens, then ACEs mediate some of the observed effects of education on stress",

And, what may be some limitations both methodologicall and conceptually? Whereas we know this analysis is not causal, we can begin linking the results to some important policy implications See Barboza-Salerno (2020) here .",

Using partial and semi-partial correlations, we disentangle the direct and indirect effects of early-life adversity on maternal stress, providing insights for interventions aimed at reducing stress-related health disparities. If ACEs remains a significant predictor of stress after controlling for education, interventions targeting early life adversity may help alleviate psychosocial stress during pregnancy, improving both maternal and child health outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nBarboza-Salerno, G.

The absolute value of d still represents the effect size.\n\n22.4.1 Key Findings\n🔹 A large Cohen’s d suggests significant deprivation disparities between counties with low and high deprivation.\n🔹 This reinforces the need for economic policies addressing regional deprivation.\n🔹 Mapping ADI allows for geographically targeted interventions to reduce socioeconomic inequalities.",

    "text": "22.5 Conclusion\nThe effect size tells us that the ADI in low-deprivation counties is 3.39 standard deviations higher than in high-deprivation counties. Since Cohen’s d is standardized, this means the deprivation difference is very large in relative terms. This analysis confirms that county-level deprivation is strongly associated with huge disparities in ADI, with high-deprivation counties having more economic inequaltity, low educational attainment, and less financial strength. Future research could associate some outcome across levels of ADI.",

    "text": "Introduction to the Topic\nToday we are finishing up last week’s discussion of effect sizes and regression assumptions. Then we will turn to an even more exciting topic: dummy variables.\nIn regression analysis, many predictors are categorical rather than numerical. However, standard regression models require numerical inputs. Dummy variables are a way to include categorical variables in a regression model by converting them into numerical representations.\n\nWhat are Dummy Variables?\nA dummy variable is a binary variable (0 or 1) that represents different categories of a categorical predictor. It allows regression models to account for group differences. We will learn how to recode variables in SPSS, and R, and include them in our models. This requires understanding how to select the reference category. Read this article for a social justice application of selecting reference variables in regression models. I used this idea to code trans man as the reference category in this paper .\n\nWhy Use Dummy Variables?\n\nThey quantify categorical differences in a regression model.\nThey allow us to compare groups while controlling for other factors.\nThey help capture interaction effects when combined with numerical predictors.\n\n\n\nExtending Dummy Variables:\n\nFor variables with more than two categories, we create multiple dummy variables (e.g., for “Region: North, South, West,” we need two dummy variables to represent three categories).\nReference category: One category is omitted to prevent multicollinearity, and all other categories are compared against it.",

    "text": "Dummy Variables\nIn regression analysis, many predictors are categorical rather than numerical. However, standard regression models require numerical inputs. Dummy variables are a way to include categorical variables in a regression model by converting them into numerical representations.\n\nWhat are Dummy Variables?\nA dummy variable is a binary variable (0 or 1) that represents different categories of a categorical predictor. It allows regression models to account for group differences. We will learn how to recode variables in SPSS, and R, and include them in our models. This requires understanding how to select the reference category. Read this article for a social justice application of selecting reference variables in regression models. I used this idea to code trans man as the reference category in this paper .\n\nWhy Use Dummy Variables?\n\nThey quantify categorical differences in a regression model.\nThey allow us to compare groups while controlling for other factors.\nThey help capture interaction effects when combined with numerical predictors.\n\n\n\nExtending Dummy Variables:\n\nFor variables with more than two categories, we create multiple dummy variables (e.g., for “Region: North, South, West,” we need two dummy variables to represent three categories).\nReference category: One category is omitted to prevent multicollinearity, and all other categories are compared against it.",

As I mentioned in class, this trick has almost never worked with the datasets I use. However, I was successful in transforming the dependent variable once, using a cultivated dataset on area deprivation, housing, and “child maltreatment” substantiations which can be accessed here. I have used these data often see Elise Barboza-Salerno (2024) for an example.\nThe cultivated dataset comes from many sources. The H+T index comes from this website. The ADI comes from the sociome package in R, and we saw an example when we learned how to quantify effect sizes with Cohen’s D. I calculated the distances to SNAP retail locations from home addresses based on information from the SNAP retail locator, which can be accessed here.\nTest yourself on partial mediation, full mediation, and supression: I created sample output for each effect, can you select the correct model that illustrates each mechanism?\nMediation: We will use a subset of the NSCAW I to examine whether symptoms of post-traumatic stress mediate the association between exposure to violence at Wave I and child externalizing behaviors at Wave III. Now DON’T LOOK at the model write-up until AFTER you have the analysis done. Then, and only then, can you take a gander at my write-up here",

The current study examined latent class trajectories of depressive symptoms using data from 3,819 respondents of the Adolescent Health Survey. Four trajectory profiles of depressive symptoms were identified: low-stable, high-decreasing, low-increasing, and moderate-decreasing. A broad array of risk factors were included into the modeling procedure to identify predictors of group membership. Relative to the low-stable group, membership in one of the three symptomatic groups (i.e., heightened depressive symptoms) was predicted by poverty, low self-esteem, gender, drinking frequency, poor academic outcomes, delinquency, and child maltreatment type. This study contributes to our understanding about the longitudinal manifestations of depression and identifies a broad array of factors significantly related to pathways of resilience.\n\n\nElise Barboza, G., & Siller, L.

Most of the literature examining the relationship between child physical abuse (CPA) and adult violence has focused narrowly on academic outcomes rather than taking a broader view that explores the processes undergirding school engagement and connections. The present study adopted Connell?s model of school engagement, connectedness and outcomes within a social bond framework to examine (a) the link between CPA and school social bonds, (b) the link between CPA and adult violence persistence, and (c) the mediational (parallel, serial) effects of school bonds (engagement, connection, and achievement) on violence perpetration in adulthood. Consistent with previous research, results indicated that children who experience physical abuse have poorer academic performance, which, in turn, is related to future violent trajectories. We further found that the relationship between CPA and violence persistence is mediated by a process of bonding to school that begins with being actively engaged in school activities and ends with higher levels of academic achievement. In particular, some of the ?school achievement? effect found in previous research operates through behavioral and emotional manifestations and may be partly explained through physically abused children?s lessened ability to be engaged with and connected to school activities.

Children and Youth Services Review, 157, 107371. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2023.107371Child maltreatment is a critical public health problem whose structural underpinnings underscore the need to move prevention efforts from individual-level risk factors to social policy. Despite previous studies exploring the evolution of child maltreatment risk in socially vulnerable contexts, little is known about how neighborhood level material deprivation and job market characteristics, beyond the employment context, impact substantiated maltreatment risk. The present analysis integrates multiple streams of data to explore the complexity of child maltreatment in the most populous county in New Mexico as a case-study. A geospatial model was used to produce posterior risk estimates and exceedance probabilities of substantiated child maltreatment derived from administrative records controlling for financial strength, economic inequality and hardship, educational attainment, housing and food insecurity and labor market characteristics. Findings showed that over the nine-year study period, the average relative risk of child maltreatment increased substantially, however, there was substantial regional and temporal heterogeneity. More specifically, substantiated child maltreatment risk became more highly concentrated into the most deprived 20% of neighborhoods over time. The results showed a very strong area deprivation effect such that: (1) the risk of maltreatment in the most deprived 20% of neighborhoods on financial strength was 130.78% higher compared to the least deprived 20% of neighborhoods; and (2) maltreatment rates in the bottom 20% of neighborhoods on economic inequality and hardship were 40.52% higher compared to the least deprived 20% of neighborhoods. Finally, substantiated child maltreatment was significantly associated with multiple labor market characteristics including commuting times to work, origin–destination job flows, and mode of transportation to work. From a policy perspective, the results of this study support structural interventions aimed at reducing neighborhood-level material hardship and labor market disadvantage as avenues to support parents so that children and families can thrive.",

Here is my sample abstract (~250 words) based on the above write-up, and formatted for the conference.\n\nBackground\nMaternal smoking during pregnancy remains a significant public health concern, with implications for both maternal and child health. Psychosocial risk factors such as adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), a history of abuse, and perinatal depression may contribute to smoking behaviors. This study investigates the association between these factors and smoking during the first trimester of pregnancy while also examining racial/ethnic disparities.\n\n\nMethods\nData were drawn from the Kentucky Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). The final analytical sample consisted of 5,172 participants. Linear regression models were used to examine the association between smoking during the first trimester and key psychosocial risk factors. Race/ethnicity was included to assess disparities. Diagnostic tests were performed to evaluate model assumptions, including multicollinearity, normality, and heteroscedasticity.\n\n\nResults\nA history of abuse was associated with a 2.29-unit increase in smoking (p &lt; 0.001). Each additional ACE was linked to a 0.44-unit increase (p &lt; 0.001), with a one standard deviation increase (1.41 points) predicting a 0.62-unit increase and an interquartile range increase (2 points) predicting a 0.89-unit increase. Perinatal depression was associated with a 1.04-unit increase in smoking (p &lt; 0.001). Mothers with a history of abuse smoked 1.85 more cigarettes per day than those without abuse. Hispanic mothers exhibited significantly lower smoking rates compared to Non-Hispanic Whites (p &lt; 0.001).\n\n\nConclusion\nPsychosocial factors play a crucial role in maternal smoking behaviors. Targeted interventions incorporating mental health and trauma-informed care are essential in reducing prenatal smoking rates, particularly among at-risk populations.",

Unlike simple regression, where we assess a direct relationship between an independent and dependent variable, moderation analysis allows us to examine whether this relationship varies in strength or direction based on different levels of another variable.\nModeration is particularly useful in social sciences, public health, and policy research, where the effect of an intervention or exposure may differ depending on contextual factors such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, or environmental conditions. For example, in public health studies, we might investigate whether the relationship between neighborhood poverty and child maltreatment rates is moderated by community resources or green space availability.\nThroughout this week, we will discuss how to interpret interaction effects, visualize moderation using interaction plots, and apply these concepts using statistical software. By the end of the module, you will be able to identify when moderation is appropriate, test for moderation effects, and communicate findings effectively in research and policy contexts",

    "text": "Key Concepts:\n\nDefinition: Moderation occurs when the strength or direction of the relationship between an independent variable X and a dependent variable Y depends on a third variable W, called the moderator.\nInteraction/Effect moderation: The key indicator of moderation is a statistically significant interaction term, X * W, in a regression model, suggesting that the effect of X on Y varies depending on W.\nVisualization: Simple slopes analysis and interaction plots help visualize and interpret moderation effects.\nProbing Interactions: This is an extremely useful technique in which you can detect statistically significant regions of the interaction. Super exciting!\nDistinguishing Moderation from Mediation:\n\nModeration affects the strength of the relationship between X and Y.\nMediation explains the mechanism through which X affects Y via an intermediate variable.",
