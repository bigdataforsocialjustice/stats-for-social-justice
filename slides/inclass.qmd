# In Class assignment â€“ Simple Linear Regression Mechanics

This file uses data from the 2021 BRFSS that is available for download [here](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_data.htm)

For this assignment, download the subsetted [SPSS file](brfss_aces_subset.sav) I created, and follow these steps:

1.	The BRFSS data contains information on 11 separate ACEs. The file codes them as follows 1 = the respondent endorsed the ACE; 2 = the respondent did not endorse the ACE. Create a scale that ranges from 0 (No ACEs) to 11 (ALL ACEs) representing the ACEs sum score (i.e. cumulative risk). 

2.	Report the mean, range and standard deviation of your ACEs scale.

3.	Report the correlations between all ACEs except for the three sexual abuse/assault variables (note how these variables are measured)

4.	Run a simple linear regression that predicts 1) the number of days the respondent reported being in poor mental health in the past 30 days; 2) the number of days the respondent reported being in poor physical health in the past 30 days; and 3) binge drinking. Then answer the following questions

a.	How many days on average did Respondents with no ACEs report having poor mental health? 

b.	How many days on average did Respondents with no ACEs report having poor mental health?

c.	How many days on average did the respondent report binge drinking?

d.	Interpret the slope parameter for each model. What is the null hypothesis. Comment on the statistical significance of the slope parameter.

e.	How much of the variation in mental health, physical health and binge drinking is explained by ACEs for each model respectively. What factors should be considered when interpreting R square?
